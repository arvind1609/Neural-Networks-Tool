# Neural-Networks-Tool

This is tool analysis the computational requirements to run a CNN with respect to your hardware resources. The project description is given in Description_tool.pdf

Use TensorFlow graph to get the operations and perform an analysis similar to https://dgschwend.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html. Please go throught the README.txt for more information

Note: The Prediction is approximate, however, it gives us intuitive understanding of resource management. For Example, VGG19 is one of the most resource hungry networks among other popular CNN architectures.
